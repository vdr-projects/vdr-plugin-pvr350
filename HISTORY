2007-06-09
----------
first release of "new" plugin (see README)

2007-08-07
----------
- make plugin ready for use of renamed ioctl IVTVFB_IOC_DMA_FRAME (was IVTVFB_IOCTL_PREP_FRAME)
 (thanks to Wirbel for his redesign of the code which is used to detect driver version) 
- implement setting of wss bits for 16:9/4:3 format switch (thanks to Andreas Schäfers who helped me how to set
  the bit only when format changes)

2007-10-03
----------
- assume driver 1.0.0 uses IVTVFB_IOC_DMA_FRAME
- fix Audio ID for mp2: must be 0xC0 ... 0xDF to get additional audio channels
- introduce small setup menu.
- remove support for older vdr versions than 1.3.7
- The device number /video16 is no longer hardcoded. Setup allows configuration for use with /dev/video17 ... /dev/video20

2007-10-17 (thanks to Wirbel)
----------
- started internationalization with gettext (Makefile target i18n + folder po)
- compile fix vdr version 1.5.9 (added uint Level to cPvr350Osd::cPvr350Osd and cPvr350OsdProvider::CreateOsd)

2007-11-17
----------
- implemented log level (thanks to Andreas Schäfers)
- adapted OSD to be able to display subtitles in vdr 1.5.10
- simplified includes, removed some unnecessary

2007-11-29
----------
- Use log level 4 for some functions which are called permanently and would mess up the log

2007-03-12
----------
- fixed a big bug :-) : On playmode pmExtern we need to keep the fbfd device open. Otherwise we wouldn`t have the OSD to
  control e.g mplayer

2007-08-15
----------
- create a workaround in Play() for a bug in the ivtv version which is included in Kernel
  2.6.22 (pause/continue/play handling). (Thanks to Andreas Schaefers)
- Fix subtitles for VDR >= 1.5.11 (add SetAreas)

2008-01-06
----------
- move StopDecodeLastframe() into Clear() and explicitly restart the decoder
- GetSTC() is no longer a dummy; it now delivers the pts
- Use log level 4 for ProcessAC3Audio()
- remove Clear() in cPvr350Device::StillPicture(). This was a left over from the old versions where
  Clear() did only clear the ringbuffer.
- call the base class function in Clear() and Mute() (as drescribed in vdr`s device.h)

2008-01-20
----------
- add new setup entry "WSS for pmExtern ?". If set to yes, the plugin will send a 16:9 wss bit if PlayMode is "pmExtern".
  This is useful if you use the mplayer plugin with monitoraspect 16:9. 

2008-01-26
----------
- Fix SetupParse for Pvr350Setup.WSS_169_for_pmExtern

2008-05-17
----------
- implement SetAudioChannelDevice() and GetAudioChannelDevice() for handling of bilingual audio.

2008-05-30
----------
- improve log messages

2008-08-17
----------
- strip audio packets in Stillpicture, which removes the stuttering on cut marks
- note requirement of a52dec in README (thanks to Joerg Gehlhaar <jjgehlhaar@t-online.de> )
- remove extract from linux/dvb/video.h. Instead include linux/dvb/video.h
- note requirement of recent versions of three include files in README.
- add more details about driver versions in README
- use write() instead of the ioctl IVTVFB_IOC_DMA_FRAME for ivtv driver >= 1.4.0
  (thanks to Ian Armstrong for the patch)
- compile fix for 64-bit
- fix output of esyslog errors
- change Makefile in order to delete the  *.pot-Template at "make clean"
- updated italian language file (thanks to Diego Pierotto)

2009-09-24
----------
- remove all code for old ivtv driver version 0.10.
- no longer keep the vbi device open - close it immidiately after a wss command is sent
- fix permission handling when using "make dist"
- autodetect the decoder device (in the range /dev/video16 to /dev/video20).
- remove pvr350.DeviceNumber as it is no longer needed
- adapt to vdr 1.7.9
- log a debug note about joint stereo if detected
- fix gcc 4.4 compiler warnings
- improve StillPicture
- allow playing of audio-only streams by sending a black dummy video. Thanks to 
  Reinhard Nissl for his inspiration and help!
- introduce svdrpsend commands

2009-10-10
----------
- reduce debug messages for log level INFO
- re-introduce pvr350.DeviceNumber combined with improved autodetection

2009-10-13 (Andreas Schaefers)
------------------------------
- coding style fixes
- implement mp2 recode for joint-stereo and RDS radio
- fix ac3->mp2 conversion

1.7.0-rc1
---------
- various minor changes. Seems to be stable enough to give the baby a real number now :-) 

1.7.0-rc2
---------
- if the first packet was detected falsely as audio-only, the decoder was cleared by using Clear().
  The result was that we often had a visible frame from the last channel. Changed it to stop
  the decoder with a black frame. 
- update italian translations (thanks to Diego Pierotto)

1.7.0
---------
- implement changes from Andreas Schaefers: improve error handling in ProcessAC3Audio()
  and ConvertMP2Audio() 
- don't log "... written=-1 error ..." in case "Resource temporarily unavailable". This happens
  often (especially in trickmode) and is harmless, because WriteAllOrNothing is designed to handle this.
- improve error handling for re-opening the decoder device after returning from extern PlayMode
- add a remark in README.mplayer about different files/path for the script and its config file in Debian.
- add a remark in README.mplayer about needed root privilege.
- fix OSD display while using subtitles
- adapt to vdr 1.7.11
- improve detection of RDS streams: ignore a single package
- improve CheckMPEGAudio4JointStereo (thanks to Andreas Schaefers)

1.7.1
-----
- Execute CheckMPEGAudio4JointStereo() only once after the stream has changed (e.g. channel switch
  or start replay). Note: Changing the value of Pvr350Setup.RecodeJointStereo will take effect now
  after a channels switch or after restarting playback.
  This makes sure we don't get audio breaks which could happen if CheckMPEGAudio4JointStereo()
  misdetects a pattern in a single audio package.
- Skip Pvr350Setup.RecodeRDS and introduce Pvr350Setup.RecodeMP2AudioOnly instead. 
- add a note about problems with mpg123 version 1.11.0
- re-initialize twolame library in cMP2toMP2::MP2InitParams()

1.7.2
-----
- fix a typo in Set_wss_mode(). Thanks to Lars Hanisch for reporting it.

1.7.3
-----
- fix logging of VideoAspect and PixelAspect: must be %f instead of %d
- adapt cPvr350Osd::CanHandleAreas for vdr-1.7.17
- remove videodev.h (obsolet in 2.6.38 and never needed)
